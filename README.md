# quicklibrary
This is my project in which a website for a library is created, the website is fully responsive and frontend is created by Bootstrap, You can add a book into the list by filling the details of the book and by clicking the add book button. The respective book will get added into the list along with a success message on the screen, you cannot add an invalid book into the list it will show an error message on the screen if the book and author name is smaller than 2 characters. To remove the book simply click on the remove book button and the book will get removed from the list along with success message.
